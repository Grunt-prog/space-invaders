Space Invaders, created with the Pygame library, is a classic arcade game that puts you in control of a spaceship. Positioned at the bottom of the screen, you use the left and right arrow keys to move the spaceship. Aliens ships appear at the top and move toward you in groups. Your goal is to shoot them down with lasers before they reach you. The game gets more challenging as more aliens appear. Your mission is to get the highest score and save humanity from the alien invasion, becoming the hero of the galaxy.

The game looks like:
